# üîê **PyPass - Secure Password Manager (Python + MySQL)**  

A secure, terminal-based **Password Manager** developed using **Python** with **MySQL** integration. PyPass encrypts user credentials using **AES-256** and securely stores them in a database, providing a reliable solution to manage multiple passwords effortlessly. The project offers a user-friendly console interface to add, view, update, and delete credentials, ensuring both security and convenience.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Problem Statement**  
In today's digital world, individuals have numerous accounts across various platforms. Many people tend to use weak or repeated passwords, making their accounts vulnerable to attacks. Password leaks from major websites are common, and reusing passwords across different sites can result in significant security breaches. 

To address this issue, **PyPass** was created as a simple yet powerful tool to help users securely manage their passwords. By using **AES-256 encryption** and **MySQL database integration**, PyPass ensures that sensitive credentials are stored safely and can be accessed only through a master password.

## üß© **Features**  
- **Secure Storage:** Passwords are encrypted with **AES-256** using a master password.  
- **Clipboard Integration:** Automatically copies retrieved passwords to the clipboard using **pyperclip**.  
- **User-Friendly Console Interface:** Simple terminal-based navigation to manage your credentials.  
- **Database Management:** Utilizes **MySQL** for efficient password storage.
